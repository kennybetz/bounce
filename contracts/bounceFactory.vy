## buildBouncer creates copy of original bounce contract and initializes using
## bounceONE function. Events emit data needed for followup App flow.
## create_forwarder_to "Deploys a small contract that duplicates the logic of 
## the contract at target, but has itâ€™s own state since every call to target 
## is made using DELEGATECALL to target. To the end user, this should be indistinguishable
## from an independantly deployed contract with the same code as target."
